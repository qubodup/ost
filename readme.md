# [Open Source Textures](http://qubodup.github.com/ost)

OST is intended to allow people searching for "open source textures"
to easily find examples of such.

It is a simple web page that contains some thumbnails and titles that
link to texture sections on actual content host websites.

Its use is questionable, considering that as of 2012-05-07
google.com/search?q=open+source+textures lists a Free Gamer blog post
and OpenGameArt's texture section (which is great!) but not OST.

All in all, I had fun creating this little gallery. :)
